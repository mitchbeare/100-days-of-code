# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: January 31, 2022 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Completed python basics and string manipulation excercises

**Thoughts:** I am more familiar with C# and consistently add language specific things, I need to pay more attention to spelling and the like I keep making typos

**Link to work:** [Python Strings](Day1)

## Day 2: February 10, 2022

**Today's Progess:** Completed data types and mathematical operators

**Thoughts:** Felt disheartened after missing a day, this caused me to miss more. Sometimes days might be missed due to outside influence need to know this is okay and just continue the next day. I learnt some things about how python handles data types that I did not realise intially such as it's ability to automatically assume a data type during an operation not requiring the new variable to be pre declared.
